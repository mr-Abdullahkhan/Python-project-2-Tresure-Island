🏝️ Treasure Island Game (Python)
=================================================================================

This is a beginner-level Python command-line game where the player makes choices to find hidden treasure. The game is based on user input and conditional statements.

---

**📌 Project Description**

  The program starts by welcoming the player to **Treasure Island** and giving a mission to find the treasure.
  The player must make correct choices at different stages of the game. Each choice leads to a different outcome, including winning the game or reaching a game-over scenario.

This project helped me practice Python basics such as user input, conditional statements, and logical decision-making.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

* Python 3
* Command Line / Terminal

---

**▶️ How It Works**

1. The player chooses a direction (Left or Right)
2. Based on the choice, the player encounters different situations
3. Additional choices decide the final outcome
4. The game ends with either finding the treasure or a game-over message
